# Paint Application

A simple and intuitive paint application built using Java that allows users to draw, resize, and manage various shapes and tools. This project was developed as part of a collaborative team effort for the CSC335 course under GitHub Classroom.

## **Overview**
This paint application provides an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) for creating and editing shapes, with support for a variety of tools such as brushes, erasers, and filling. It includes functionalities for undo/redo operations, resizing, and exporting drawings. The project demonstrates object-oriented programming principles and teamwork in software development.

## **Features**
- **Drawing Tools**: Supports brushes, erasers, and various shapes like rectangles, circles, squares, and triangles.
- **GUI**: Built using Java Swing for a user-friendly interface.
- **Undo/Redo Manager**: Easily revert or reapply actions.
- **Shape Resizing**: Adjust the dimensions of shapes dynamically.
- **File Management**: Save and load projects.
- **Interactive Elements**: Smooth user interaction with color selection, spray paint, and text tools.
